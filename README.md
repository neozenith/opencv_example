# OpenCV Example

Experiments in getting up to speed with OpenCV.

This documentation is far from complete or best practices but is mostly maintained
as a reminder to myself on how to get up and running. I do however strive to keep
it maintained that I may point peers to my code snippets as working examples.

# Getting started

git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git ~/opencv
